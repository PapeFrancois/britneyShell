# britneyShell
cute britney spears shell for girlies &lt;3

add the britneyShell.zsh-theme to the ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/ repo.

then, edit your .zshrc file (probably located to the root as well), comment the line ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell" and add ZSH_THEME="britneyShell"

that's all my angel, you can now become the biatch of your cluster !
